    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well.

    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tNaive Bayes is a method of supervised learning based on the application of the Bayes theorem with addition of the naive assumption that the events considered are independent. More specifically, the Gaussian Naive Bayes is more adequate to situations in which the likelihood of the features is assumed to be gaussian. Besides the spam classification example given in this course, it is also commonly used in facial recognition softwares, for example.\n",
    "    It requires a low amount of training, is relatively fast and it is a good alternative to problems with high dimensionality. It is suited for classification but is a bad estimator. Given that the charityML project is a classification problem and that it has a large amount of features as well as samples, this could be a good candidate. Also, considering that the census was well executed, there are good reasons to believe that the samples follow a gaussian distribution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Decision Trees are supervised learning tools based on tree-like data structures. It is one of the most used algorithms for supervised learning and its applications are innumerous. One in particular that is especially interesting for our application is the following, cited by GreyAtom, is: ‘Determination of likely buyers of a product using demographic data to enable targeting of limited advertisement budget’.\n",
    "    Among its advantages are: it’s simple to interpret, uses a white box model, requires little data preparation and has logarithmic cost. On the downside, it’s prone to overfit and it’s unstable in the sense that small variations in the data can result in large variations of trees. With this being said, it seems to be an adequate model to our problem with charityML. The fact that it presents logarithmic cost is considerably useful given the large number of samples that we are dealing with. Also, combined, both the simplicity to interpret results and the white box characteristic of it present an interesting advantage for our cause, since valuable information can be generated and learned for further use, for example discovering new potential donors or niches of donors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Ensemble Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tEnsemble Methods are ways of combining different machine learning models to achieve certain results. Different models can be combined in countless different ways, therefore it is very versatile. An interesting real life application is, as pointed out by Pedro Costa’s Quora answer, the winning recommending system of the Netflix Challenge, that showed the power of ensemble methods.\n",
    "\tIf correctly used, these methods can improve accuracy and increase stability and robustness. On the other hand, its design can be rather complex and laborious as well as have high computational cost and compromise model interpretability. In this case, considering the complexity of our problem is already high, using ensemble methods can complicate its solution. As well, since it can complicate the model’s reading, it might not meet charityML’s requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### K-Nearest Neighbors:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rather self explained, the KNN method classify data according the the closest related samples. According to scikit-learn it’s successfully used in satellite image scenes, for example, and other situations in which the decision boundary is very irregular.\n",
    "    First of all, KNN is very easy to implement. Also, interestingly, this model doesn’t need training, it learns from the dataset at the time of making real time predictions. Therefore it is very fast, and new data can be added seamlessly. However, it does not work well with large datasets and high dimensionality, which is our case. With this being said, it is not wise to implement it in charityML.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stochastic Gradient Descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tStochastic Gradient Descent is an alternative to gradient descent used for heavy loads of data. It is useful, for example, in applications such as natural language processing. Its advantages are mostly its efficiency, its simplicity to implement and versatility, due to many tunning options. However, it demands a high number of iterations and many hyperparameters, and it is sensitive to feature scaling. Although it might seem suited for our application, it really is designed for far bigger problems than charityML’s, such as ones with 10^5 features and samples, thus it might be a bit of an overkill. More significantly, the SGDC is designed for linear solutions, and even though it offers many tunning options, it does not adapt to a non-linear context, unlike the logistic regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vector Machines:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tSVMs are one of the most popular algorithms for classification. Its applications are several due to its versatility. In particular, it is widely used in bioinformatics, for example, for protein classification or cancer classification. It is very effective in high dimensional spaces, it’s memory efficient and, as aforementioned, it is very versatile due to its implementation with different kernel functions. Among its disadvantages, it is very prone to overfit when the number of features is much greater than the number of samples and it does not provide probability estimates, neither of which is our case. However, it does not work well with large data sets, so this might complicate our solution.\n",
    "    Remark: Further experimentation proved this to be unworkable due to long training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tLogistic regression models the probabilities for classification problems with two possible outcomes, which is the case of charityML. It’s an extension of the linear regression model for classification problems. It is normally implemented to problems with a binary nature, such as medical diagnosis. It is known for being simple to implement, high interpretable, does not need too many computational resources nor tuning.\n",
    "\tHowever, it can be a bit tricky to implement regarding the definition of the features. Since it can present some problems with correlated features, come sources advised to implement it with the support of a features engineer, so we might have to watch out for this. Also, it is suited for problems with a linear nature, but this can be worked around using the multinomial features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the chosen models are: **Gaussian Naive Bayes**, **Decision Trees** and **Logistic Regression.**\n",

    "Considering first the f-score performance, both the logistic regression and the decision tree classifier present a good result around 0.6, with a slight advantage to the former. However, the gaussian model's performance is lackluster here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the predicting time, although the gaussian model is significantly higher than the others, none of the models show any problems, since the absolute time is quite short. However, considering the training time, the gaussian model is very fast and the decision tree is medium, while the logistic performance time is unnacceptably long, being more than three times that of the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, it seems like the decision tree balances better these elements, with the best fscore vs training time trade off. In addition, we have seen that it is widely used for applications very similar to this one, which indicates that this is a safe choice. It is also highly interpretable and its white box model can be a good plus.\n",

    "The decision tree algorithm is applied to making predictions based on someone's data of who is likely to donate to the organization. The tree is a logical model based on the analogy of the ramifications due to the decision making. For instance, whether a person is male or female - or younger or older than 45 years old - divides the samples in two groups (or branches). A tree is a set of consecutive divisions based on specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is designed in a way that running a sample through the tree, based on its characteristics, it will end up in one of the possible outcomes: likely donator or unlikely to donate. This model is trained based on previous data and it is very accurate and easy to interpret.\n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

Interestingly, in contrast, the most relevant features according to the Decision Tree model used before are: marital status, capital gain, education number, capital loss and age. We can see that capital gain and loss, age and education number are on both predictions.\n",

The other descriptive fields, perhaps because of their treatment such as one hot encoding, are deconstructed into more fields, which might explain why they did not appear as relevant."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "As expected, cutting out features considerably reduces accuracy and f-score, the latter especially. However, the increase in agility is noticeable and this could be extremely useful in a number of contexts in which training time is a factor. For example, while dealing with a large number of data or a real time application - say, a web application - having a simple and agile model is essential, and in this case I would definitely consider using the reduced data as my training set."
